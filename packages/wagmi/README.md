  Enable gas sponsorship and transaction batching for your app with just a couple lines of code.

<br />
permissionless/wagmi is a TypeScript library built on top of permissionless.js
and wagmi for quickly enabling support for EIP-5792 features on your app,
including gas sponsorship and transaction batching, with just a couple lines of
code. We built @permissionless/wagmi to allow app developers to support the
features of new smart accounts such as Coinbase Smart Wallet without any of the
complexity.

# Overview

```tsx [main.tsx]
import { PermissionlessProvider } from "@permissionless/wagmi";

function Main() {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <PermissionlessProvider
          capabilities={capabilities}
        >
          {/** ... */}
        </PermissionlessProvider>
        {" "}
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
}
```

```tsx [app.tsx]
import { useSendTransaction, useWaitForTransactionReceipt } from "wagmi"
import { 
    useSendTransaction, 
    useWaitForTransactionReceipt 
} from "@permissionless/wagmi" 

function App() {
  const {
    sendTransaction,
    data: transactionReference,
    isPending
  } = useSendTransaction()
  
  const { data: receipt, isPending: isReceiptPending } =
    useWaitForTransactionReceipt({
      hash: "0x1234"
      id: transactionReference 
    })

  const sendTransactionCallback = useCallback(async () => {
    console.log("Sending transaction...")
    sendTransaction({
      to: "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045",
      data: "0x1234"
    })
  }, [sendTransaction])

}
```

And that's it!

# Features

- **ERC-7677 Paymaster service**: Makes it easier to interact with an external
  smart account that offers support.
- **Sending multiple transactions**: Makes it easier to send multiple
  transactions from an external smart account.
- **Built on & for wagmi**: `@permissionless/wagmi` is designed to be a thin
  wrapper around wagmi, maintaining the same style and overall feel wagmi
  provides.
- and a lot more coming soon...
